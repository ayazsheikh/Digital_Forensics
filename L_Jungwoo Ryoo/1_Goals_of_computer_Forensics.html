    <h4>Goals of Computer Forensics</h4>
    <dfn
      >The Ultimate Goal of Computer Forensics is to produce evidence for legal
      cases. To achieve this, there are four objectives</dfn
    >
    <ol>
      <li>
        Objective 1: To prepare for an investigation by ensuring the integrigy
        of the evidence.
      </li>
      <li>Objective 2: To acquire the data.</li>
      <li>Objective 3: Analyse the data</li>
      <li>Objective 4: Identify evdence and present it.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Origin of Computer Forensics.</h4>
    <p>
      Computer forensics originated from practical needs in the law enforcement
      community. Criminals stared using computers to commit crimes and officers
      in the trenches simply had to deal with this new phenomenon. One of the
      first official recognitions of computer forensics in the U.S as a separate
      field of its own was the formation of a Computer Analysis Response Team,
      or CART, by Federal Bureau of Investigation, or FBI, in 1984. As the field
      matured, more players appeared. Federal Law Enforcement Training Center,
      or FLETC, starting offering training in collecting digital data.
      International Organization for Standardization, or ISO, published a new
      standard called ISO 17025, general requirements for the competence of
      testing and calibration laboratories in 2005. Since crimes have no
      borders, countries also had to work together to reconcile the differences
      in their laws to successfully prosecute criminals. Europeans led this
      effort and played a major role in establishing a treaty of the Convention
      on Cybercrime in 2004 and the U.S. signed the treaty. As an astute viewer,
      you may notice the change of terms used here. The word cyber is a
      shorthand for cyberspace and refers to a virtual environment where
      exchanges of information occur between computing devices. The word
      cybercrime emphasizes the fact that computer crimes are no longer confined
      in a single, isolated machine, but touch on a collection of devices
      connected through a communications network which is often the internet.
      The term cybercrime complements the more conventional label computer
      crime. Therefore, we're increasingly seeing both computer and cyber used
      together in media as in computer and cyber forensics. You can also use
      digital forensics to cover both computer and cyber forensics because
      digital means anything touching on zeros and ones, which computers and
      cyber spaces do. Since its humble beginning in the 1970s, computer
      forensics has seen an explosive growth and continues to expand its scope.
      Newly emerging technologies, such as Internet of Things, or IoT, are
      constantly pushing the limits of the field. I'm sure that IoT will soon be
      replaced by some future successor which will help keep expanding the field
      of digital forensics.
    </p>
    <h4>Type of Investigation</h4>
    <p>
      There are two types of Investigation 1. Public 2. Private Public
      investigations occur in the context of criminal cases. Usually conducted
      by the law enforcement officers and driven by the statutes in the criminal
      law. Some examples of public investigations involve drug crimes, sexual
      exploitation, and theft. Private investigations occur in the context of
      civil cases. Organizations try to avoid any form of litigations, due to
      the enormous associated cost. As a result, many private investigations
      simply turn out to be internal cases. Private investigations are typically
      conducted by corporations or similar types of organizations. They're
      driven by the statutes of the civil law, or organizational policies. One
      of the most important things to consider in private investigations is
      business continuity. If your investigation is hurting your business bottom
      line, the investigation is probably not worth it. Therefore, your priority
      has to be actually stopping the violations rather than litigating. Some
      examples of private investigations include sabotage, embezzlement, and
      industrial espionage. Also, the boundary between public and private
      investigations is not always very clear. For example, when you're
      investigating an employee for a potential violation of company policies,
      and come across illegal pornography, the job quickly turns into a public
      case. Because of this reason, as a computer forensics investigator, you
      should be able to handle both public, and private cases.
    </p>
    <h4>Tools for COmputer Forensics</h4>
    <p>
      There are many tools of the trade in computer forensics. Some of these
      tools are software based, others are hardware based. Many computer
      forensic software tools exist in the form of a software suite. They
      usually have a comprehensive set of features that cover an investigation
      from the beginning to its completion. Some of these features include the
      ability to acquire and process data, conduct searches, and generate
      reports. In case by Guardian Software is one such software suite. Here is
      their website in case you'd like to check it out. Depending on the nature
      of your case there are times you need specialized software tools other
      than a computer forensics software suite because sometimes they don't
      provide the particular feature you're looking for. For example, if you had
      to retrieve hidden text in an image file, a general purpose computer
      forensics tool wouldn't be able to help you. For that you need specialized
      software called a steganography tool similar to the one you're seeing
      here. There are also special hardware needs. Forensic software is
      demanding in terms of processing power, memory size, and disk space. The
      more of these resources you have, the better. Forensics workstations also
      feature extra bays and additional ports to help with pic expansions. In
      addition to the computer forensics workstation, you may also need some
      special equipment such as a write blocker, which prevents an operating
      system from writing over an evidence drive. There are also software write
      blockers out there, but a lot of times hardware write blockers are
      preferred because of their simple and surefire nature. Although it's not
      very special, another tool you need in your computer forensics arsenal is
      a large capacity storage device. Evidence drives are often large capacity
      devices and they are getting bigger as we speak. Regardless of our
      backgrounds, we all know very well that having an effective tool at hand
      can make a night and day difference. The same applies to computer
      forensics. To be effective as a computer forensics investigator you have
      to have as many relevant tools as possible and throughout this course
      we'll explore many of these tools I've mentioned.
    </p>
    <h4>Legal Implications</h4>
    <p>
      There are some important legal consequences you should be aware of as a
      computer forensics investigator. If you conduct your computer forensics
      investigation improperly, all the evidence you collect could be thrown out
      of court. Even worse, you could get into legal trouble if you're not
      careful. In the context of a public investigation, one of the first things
      you have to consider is the Fourth Amendment. As you know, the Fourth
      Amendment protects you from unauthorized search and seizure. Therefore, as
      a computer forensics investigator, it's important that you obtain a
      warrant by putting together a document called an affidavit to justify your
      warrant. In the context of a private investigation, the Fourth Amendment
      is often not a major issue, because your investigation is driven by
      internal policies rather than the statutes of the law. Employers ask their
      employees to give their consent to comply with these policies when a job
      offer is made. Whether part of a public or private case, for your evidence
      to be accepted by the court, you must ensure the reproducibility and
      verifiability of your evidence. You can accomplish this by following
      systematic procedures in your computer forensics investigations when you
      are collecting and analyzing data. For example, the use of chain of
      custody forms and evidence lockers are critical, especially when you're
      trying to make sure there is little chance of tampering. Chain of custody
      forms allow you to keep track of who handled your evidence while evidence
      lockers are secure containers to store physical evidence. One way of
      ensuring verifiability is by the use of hashing. Let's say that you have
      data on an original storage device or evidence drive and a hash algorithm
      produces value A based on that data, then you make a copy of the drive If
      the same algorithm produces hash value B out of the duplicate and if A and
      B match, the validity of the copy is verified. In this course, we have a
      dedicated lesson where we look into hashing in more detail. If you can
      generate the same hash value over and over again with the same file and
      software tool, reproducibility is proven. The Fourth Amendment,
      verifiability, and reproducibility are what you should always keep in mind
      as a computer forensics professional. How you conduct your investigation
      with respect to these principles may have a significant legal impact. To
      avoid unintended consequences, following the best practices is essential.
    </p>
    <h4>Anti-forensics techniques</h4>
    <p>
      There is an ongoing race between criminals and computer forensic
      professionals. The law breakers are always seeking ways to evade the
      investigators. Sometimes bad guys get unexpected help from operating
      system or OS vendors. To protect the privacy of its users, OS companies
      strengthen their encryption, which could keep good guys from doing their
      work. It's a delicate balance. Encryption is one of the most daunting
      challenges computer forensic specialists are facing today, because it
      prevents investigators from reading the data they need to conduct an
      investigation. Another obstacle is an attempt to erase evidence from
      various media, like a solid state drive. Depending on how you delete your
      data, it's impossible to recover it. When you delete a file, your OS
      doesn't actually remove it from a storage device. It simply marks the area
      the file is occupying as deleted, so it can be overwritten later. A tech
      savvy criminal can easily use a software tool to override the section
      designated as deleted and make it permanently erased. Metadata provides
      information on different aspects of data. If your data is a digital photo,
      it's metadata includes facts like when the photo was taken and which
      device took the photo. OS's keep metadata about files including names,
      sizes, timestamps and, most importantly, where the files are stored.
      Corrupting or deleting the metadata will make it extremely difficult to
      reconstruct or find the file. Preventing metadata from being created all
      together, is another option. An example is suppressing the changes of
      timestamps every time revisions are made. This will throw off
      investigators because they'll be confused about the sequence of file
      change events. There are also more creative ways to avoid detection and
      hide information. One of the methods is using stegonography, often favored
      by spies. They can embed information in a picture file subtly so that the
      image is not significantly altered. If done well, it's almost impossible
      to tell the difference between an original image and it's tempered
      version, as you can see on the Guardian Project website where they offer a
      stegonography app. A more general method to hide data is to put it in
      unreachable places that are undetectable by computer forensic software. A
      slack space, which is a leftover created when the writing a file system is
      a popular choice for this. More advanced techniques can destroy evidence
      once they detect an attempt to forensically analyze a digital medium. New
      anti-forensic techniques are always emerging and there are many more under
      development as we speak. This race between defenders and violators will
      continue as long as there is money to be made through computer and cyber
      crimes.

    <h4>Compliance and Forensics</h4>
    <p>
      Computer forensics is an essential component in meeting compliance
      requirements. Depending on the industry, organizations have to comply with
      different rules and regulations. The Health Insurance Portability and
      Accountability Act, or HIPAA, of 1996, stipulates the protection of
      personally identifiable information, or PII, in the healthcare and
      insurance industries. The National Institute of Standards and Technology,
      or NIST, is a nonregulatory agency of the US Department of Commerce. NIST
      SP 800-66 is a publication designed to help implement the HIPAA security
      rule. SP here stands for Special Publication. The NIST guide clearly
      specifies computer forensics requirements and regulations. In particular,
      it discusses establishing an audit trail that can support a forensics
      investigation after an incident. An audit trail is a set of chronological
      records that document security-relevant events. Various log messages
      generated by software and hardware are an example of an audit trail. If
      handling credit card transactions, an organization is responsible for
      adhering to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, or PCI-DSS.
      PCI-DSS imposes annual audit reports to ensure that organizations take
      proper security precautions while processing customer credit card
      information. It mandates a process to provide a timely computer forensics
      investigation after a compromise occurs. The Federal Information Security
      Management Act, or FISMA, of 2002, requires federal organizations to
      generate and retain an immutable audit trail that enables a computer
      forensics investigation after a security incident. As you can see,
      computer forensics plays a crucial role in ensuring that an organization
      remains compliant with cybersecurity rules and regulations. This is one
      more reason to learn about computer forensics if you're involved in any
      aspects of the cybersecurity industry.
    </p>
    <h4>Cybersecurity and Forensics</h4>
    <p>
      Cybercrimes are increasingly affecting our lives. We routinely hear new
      stories about data breaches and find ourselves wondering about whether
      criminals stole our data or not. Cybersecurity is all about preventing and
      responding to cybercrimes, which requires the heavy use of computer
      forensics techniques. Whenever there is a security incident such as
      unauthorized access to a server, it's crucial to trace back to the source
      of the attack and to understand how it happened. By doing this, we find
      out the extent of the damage and take appropriate actions. We can also
      prevent future attacks by making adjustments according to the lessons we
      learn from a thorough investigation. Since the evidence of a cybercrime is
      mostly present on computing devices like laptops, routers, and firewalls,
      a computer forensics investigation must accompany every cybersecurity
      action. Due to this close relationship between cybersecurity and computer
      forensics, professionals are paying more attention to developing
      additional skills specific to handling cybercrimes. An expertise required
      to more effectively investigate a cybercrime is knowledge in computer
      networking which is the study of connecting machines using various media
      including radio signals, internet, and fiber optics cables. As computer
      forensics workers who are seeking more specialization in cybersecurity
      towards computer networking, they created an entirely new discipline
      called network forensics. This subfield of computer forensics focuses on
      violations and crimes occurring in the context of a computer network. As
      you can see, cybercrimes and computer forensics are now inseparable, and
      you need to develop at least a reasonable understanding of computer
      networking to play any significant role in a computer forensics
      investigation.
