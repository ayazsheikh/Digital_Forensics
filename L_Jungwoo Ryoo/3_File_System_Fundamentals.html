        <h4>Understanding File System</h4>
        <p>Understanding how an operating system or OS stores files is critical in computer forensics because criminals use this knowledge to hide information. File systems determine how an OS stores data on a storage device. One of the most widely used Windows file systems today is File Allocation Table or FAT. There's a new Windows feel system called New Technology File System or NTFS. The main difference between FAT and NTFS is the file structure database used to store file metadata and to keep track of the location of the file data. FAT uses File Allocation Table as a file structure database while NTFS uses Master File Table or MFT. Let's go over some terminology here before we go any further. In the context of file systems, metadata refers to the data about files. For example, data such as file name, timestamps and other file attributes could be considered as metadata. File data is the actual data stored in a file. It's also important to know the difference between sectors and clusters. Each sector contains 512 bytes of data. Newer hard drives us 4,096 byte sectors. Clusters are the smallest logical unit of file storage. They consist of one or more sectors. Knowing the distinction between logical and physical file storage units is crucial too. Logical file storage unit is what is recognized by an operating system, clusters are logical units. Physical file storage unit is what is recognized by a storage device. Sectors are physical units. Therefore we know that your physical storage device deals with sectors while your OS handles logical storage units, namely clusters. Your operating system stores a file at the cluster level. Because the files are stored in clusters, this is what causes a wasted space problem. Let's say that you have a file whose size is 2,050 bytes. Also assume that a cluster consists of two sectors. As you can see in this diagram, your file whose size is 2,050 bytes cannot fit in two clusters. The file requires three clusters to be stored. Next time your operating system starts writing a new file, it starts after the third cluster. Because of this, there is this unused space in cluster number three, as you can see in blue, and this unused wasted space is called a slack. When it comes to efficiency, NTFS is more efficient because it uses a smaller cluster size compared to FAT which means it reduces the amount of slack spaces resulting in less wasted spaces. The latest Windows file system is Resilient File System or ReFS. It builds on the success of its predecessors and is an attempt to address the newly emerging challenges file systems are facing. ReFS aims at making the Windows files system more compatible, available, and scalable. However, ReFS has its own shortcomings and is not a replacement for NTFS yet. Have you noticed that we only focused on Windows file systems in this lesson? Linux and macOS file systems are entirely new topics. </p>
        <h4>Understanding the Boot Sequence</h4>
        <p>Understanding the concept of Boot Sequence as a computer forensic investigator is mandatory because you often have to modify it to protect the integrity of your evidence. Some of the Boot Sequence related hardware include CMOS and BIOS. CMOS is a volatile memory chip containing time and date information as well as other configuration information. CMOS stands for Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor. It's a computer chip on a motherboard. BIOS stores a program that loads hardware drivers. It also loads an operating system. Before your operating system is loaded into the main memory you have to make the memory hardware operational which is done by loading the driver for the memory. BIOS stands for Basic Input/Output System. The BIOS hardware is now being replaced by a new alternative which is called Unified Extensible Firmware Interface or UEFI. One of the things your BIOS checks when your computer starts is the Boot Sequence. The Boot Sequence information is stored in your CMOS and the Boot Sequence setting decides which drive to access to read operating system code. This is significant to computer forensics especially because we're always trying to avoid changing the evidence drive accidentally. As soon as your operating system has access to your evidence drive, it could attempt to write to it and therefore compromise your evidence. The best practice is to boot from a drive containing a specialized operating system with pre-installed computer forensics programs. You can create an USB stick containing a forensic distribution of a Linux operating system. All you have to do is to plug the USB drive into your computer, which will provide an operating system for the machine you're investigating and not touch anything on your evidence drive. This is just one example of how to leverage your Boot Sequence for a computer forensics investigation. There are also many other uses. By learning more about them you'll enhance your chance of a successful investigation.</p>
        <h4>Understanding Disk Drives</h4>
        <p>Hard disk drives provide a relatively cheap way of storing data. As a computer forensics specialist, you often have to recover data from hard disk drives, and therefore it's essential to understand how they work to do your job effectively. Let's get started by learning some terminology. There are multiple disks inside your hard disk drive. Those are called platters. On both sides of the platters, you have read/write heads. That's one read/write head on each side. A platter is divided into tracks and sectors for addressing purposes. As you can see in this picture, tracks are concentric circular patterns on which data is written. Sectors are evenly-divided sections of a track which typically hold 512 or 4,096 bytes of data. The reason why your platter is divided into tracks and sectors is that they allow you to locate a piece of information which is important. Based on the track number and the sector numbers, you'll know exactly where the data is stored, and that information is stored in a database so that that when there's a need to locate that piece of information, you can always come back to the same location. A cylinder is a collection of tracks at the same location on multiple platters as you can see in this diagram. The total capacity of a hard disk drive can be decided by the number of cylinders, sectors, and heads. If you have 1,000 cylinders, 32 sectors, and 100 heads, the total capacity of the hard disk drive can be computed by multiplying all these three numbers. We assume that each sector consists of 512 bytes, that's why we multiply 512 at the end of the process. As a result, in this case, you have 1.6 gigabyte of capacity based on the number of cylinders, sectors, and heads.</p>
        <h4>Understanding the master boot record (MBR)</h4>
        <p>Once your BIOS select a disk drive to boot from, the master boot record or MBR on your disk is then accessed. The physical drive you're booting from contains the MBR and it keeps track of information on partitions on a storage device such as locations of your partition, the sizes of your partition and the bootable status of your partition, because at least one of your partitions has to be set up as bootable so that your computer can boot. The disc you're booting from can also contain a piece of software called boot loader. The boot loader is a program that displays the menu screen you see when you start your computer and it typically gives you options for different operating systems. For example, it could display a message that allows you to select either Windows 10 or LINUX operating system. Your MBR is located in the first sector of a storage device. There are some software solutions you should be aware of regarding MBR. One of the software you can use to edit your MBR is called fdisk. Your MBR is located in the first sector of storage device. There are some software solutions we've already seen such as fdisk and its graphical user interface version called GParted. You can use them to edit your MBR. GRUB is an example of a boot loader, which is typically installed by your LINUX operating system.</p>
        <h4>Understanding Partitions</h4>
        <p>Partitioning creates an illusion to an operating system and makes a single physical storage device show up as multiple, logical drives. For example, a physical hard drive can be partitioned into two partitions one for the operating system and applications and the other for data. By separating the data from the OS and applications if it's necessary to reinstall the OS and applications the data is not affected. In general, partitioning allows for more efficient and organized storage device management. Another very prominent use of partitioning is to make it possible to install multiple OS on a single physical drive. This way, one can have multiple OS options during a boot process and choose to boot into a particular OS. A typical set-up for this is a multi-boot system that allows you to boot into either Windows or Linux OS on the same computer. There are two types of partitions, primary and extended. There could be up to four primary partitions. However, you can overcome this limit by making one of the primary partitions as an extended partition. The extended partition can have an unlimited number of logical partitions in it although the number of partitions depends on the size of the extended partition. Windows OS can be only installed on primary partitions while Linux OS can be installed on a logical partition too. Fdisk is a tool that allows a user to partition a storage device. It can display the current partitions add a new partition and remove an existing partition. GParted is a graphical user interface, or GUI front-end for fdisk which provides easier and more intuitive way to use the fdisk features. We'll look at fdisk and GParted more closely.</p>
