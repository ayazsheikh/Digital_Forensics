<h4 class="text-bg-primary p-3">Understanding Computer Forensics</h4>
<p><dfn>Computer forensics refer to a set of methodological procedures and techniques that help identify, gather, preserve, extract, interpret, document and present evidence from computing equipment, such that discovered evidence is acceptanle during a legal and/or administrative proceeding.</dfn></p>
<h4 class="text-bg-primary p-3">Objectives of Computer Forensics</h4>
<p><ol>
<li>Identify, gather and preserve the evidence of a cybercrime.</li>
<li>Gather evidence of cyber crimes in a forensically sound manner.</li>
<li>Estimate the potential impact of malicious activity on the victim and assess the intent of the perpetrator</li>
<li>Minimize the tangible and intangible losses to the organization.</li>
<li>Protect the organization from similar incidents in the future.</li>
<li>Support the prosecution of the prepetrator of an incident.</li>
</ol></p>
<h4 class="text-bg-primary p-3">Need for Computer Forensics</h4>
<p><ol>
<li>To ensure the overall integrity and continued existence of IT systems and network infrastructure within the organizations.</li>
<li>To extract, process, and interpret the factual evidence such that it proves the attacker's actions in court.</li>
<li>To efficiently track down perpetrators from different parts of the world.</li>
<li>To protect the organization's financial resources and valuable time.</li>
</ol></p>
<h4 class="text-bg-primary p-3">When do you use Computer Forensics</h4>
<p><ul>
<li>Prepare for incidents by securing and strengthening the defense mechanizm as well as closing the loop holes in security.</li>
<li>Identify the actions needed for incident response.</li>
<li>Act against copyright and intellectual property theft misuse.</li>
<li>Estimate and minimize the damage to resources in a corporate setup.</li>
<li>Set a secuirty parameter and formulate secuirty norms for ensuring forensics rediness.</li>
</ul></p>
<h4 class="text-bg-primary p-3">Types of Cybercrimes</h4>
<dfn>Cybercrime is defined as any illegal act involving a computing device, network, its system, or its applications.<dfn>
<p>
<table>
<thead>Cybercrime can be categorized into two types based on the line of attack</thead>
<tr>
<td>Internal/Insider Attack</td>
<td>External Attack</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>It is an attack performed on a corporate network or on a single computer by an entrusted person (insider) who has authorized access to the network.</td>
<td>This type of accack occurs when an attacker from outside the organization tries to gain unauthorized access to its computing systems or informational asset.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Such insiders can be former or current employees, business partners, or contractors</td>
<td>These attackers exploit secuirty loopholes or use social engineering techniques to inflitrate the network.</td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>
<h4 class="text-bg-primary p-3">Example of Cybercrimes </h4>
<ul>
<li>Espionage</li>
<li>Intellectual Property Theft</li>

<h4 class="text-bg-primary p-3">Understanding Digital Evidence</h4>
<p><ol>
<li><dfn>Digital evidence is defined as "any information of probative value that is either stored or transmitted in a digital form".</dfn></li>
<li>Digital evidence is circumstantial and fragile in nature, which makes it difficult for a forensic investigator to trace criminal activities.</li>
<li>According to Locard's Exchange Principle, "anyone or anything, entering a crime scene takes something of the scene with them, and leaves something of themselves behind when they leave."</li>
</ol>
</p>
<h4 class="text-bg-primary p-3">Types of Digital Evidence</h4>
<p>Volatile Data: Data that are lost as soon as the device is powered off; examples include system time, logged-on users, open files, network information, process information, process-to-port mapping, process memory, clipboard contents, service/driver information, command history etc.</p>
<p>Non Volatile Data: Permanent data stored on secondary storage devices such as hard disks and memory cards; examples include hidden files, slack space, swap file, index.dat files, unallocated clusters, unused partitions, hidden partitions, registry settings, event logs, etc</p> 
<p>The enemy of Volatile Data and Non-Volatile Data is TIME </p>
<h4 class="text-bg-primary p-3">Roles of Digital Evidence</h4>
<p>Examples of cases where digital evidence may assist the forensic investigator in the prosecution or defense of a suspect:
<ol>
<li>Identity Theft</li>
<li>Malicious attacks on the computer systems themselves</li>
<li>Information Leakage</li>
<li>Unauthrized transmission of information</li>

<h4 class="text-bg-primary p-3">Rules of Evidence</h4>
<p> Digital Evidence collection must be governed by five basic rules that make it admissible in a court of law:
<ol>
<li>Understandable - Evidence must be clear and understandable to the judges</li>
<li>Admissible - Evidence must be realated to the fact being proved</li>
<li>Authentic - Evidence must be real and appropriately related to the incident</li>
<li>Reliable - There must be no doubt about the authenticity or veracity of the evidence</li>
<li>Complete - The evidence must prove the attacker's actions or his/her innocence</li>
</ol></p>
<h4 class="text-bg-primary p-3">Best Evidence Rule</h4>
<p>
It states that the court only allows the original evidence of a document, photograph, or recording at the trial rather than a copy. However, the duplicate can be accepted as evidence, provided the court finds the party's reasons for submitting the duplicate to be genuine.
</p>
<p>The priciple underlying the best evidence rule is that the original evidence is considered as the best evidence.
</p>
<h4 class="text-bg-primary p-3">Federal Rules of Evidence (United States)</h4>
<p>These rules shall be construed to secure fairness in administration, elimination of unjustifiable expense and delay, and promotion of growth and development of the law of evidence to the end that the turh may be ascertained and proceedings justly determined.
</p>
<h4 class="text-bg-primary p-3">Scientific Working Group on Digital Evidence (SWGDE)</h4>
<p>Principle 1
