  <h4>Tools and Knowledge requirements</h4>
  <p>There are some prerequisites to starting a digital forensics investigation. These include basic hardware and software tools, which require significant investments. Maintenance is an important aspect to consider. Hardware needs replacing every once in awhile. Software also demands upgrading because new versions are coming out constantly. Managers shouldn't forget the fact that time is also money. Free software sounds good initially, but it could become a time sink when there is little professional support available to help a team to configure an application properly. It may well be the case that the software becomes obsolete once its development stops due to some obscure problems associated with the project. If this happens, you lose all your investments into the software. For one, your expertise in the software product becomes useless because you have to abandon it, and find its replacement. This is why it's important to always consider the total cost of ownership, or TCO, when it comes to owning hardware and software. Think about all the resources being allocated during the entire lifespan of a solution when you're making your important purchasing decisions. Compared to software and hardware, your investments into training and education are relatively safer bets as long as your make sound choices in what to learn. Learning fundamentals like number systems stay with you for your entire career, although updating and upgrading your knowledge are paramount to stay relative as a digital forensics professional. This is why I'm covering classic concepts like hexadecimal numbers and offset. I call them classic because they will never become obsolete.</p>
 <h4>Hardware Tools</h4>
 <p> There are some hardware tools you need as a digital forensics investigator to function effectively. One of the essential requirements for digital forensics hardware is efficiency. Mainly in terms of speed. As a digital forensics investigator, you spend a lot of your time on mundane things such as waiting for your imaging process to be over and looking for information. Depending on how fast your computer is, you can finish these tasks very quickly, therefore, the speed of your digital forensics hardware is critical. Another requirement for your digital forensics hardware is capacity. Your digital forensics hardware demands more memory and storage, as well as extra base or slots. The third requirement is compatibility. In your investigations, you'll be coming across many different types of operating systems or software applications. There are also various kinds of hardware you'll have to deal with. The next requirement is mobility or portability. When you show up at a crime scene, there are some initial digital forensics tasks you have to accomplish. Which is why some of the digital forensics hardware you need has to be more portable. When in a lab environment, you have access to a full-blown digital forensics work station, however, at a crime scene, you need the scale down version of the same hardware, especially in the form of a field kit. One of the major elements of the field kit is a laptop configured as a digital forensics workstation. There are also some miscellaneous digital forensics hardware like flash lights, antistatic evidence bags, cameras, chain of custody forms, cables, and screwdrivers. Antistatic evidence bags are particularly important when handling sensitive electronics. Touching them with your bare hands can cause a short-circuit which makes the evidence useless. Using an antistatic evidence bag prevents this from happening. There is a wide variety of specialized digital forensics hardware, what we've discussed so far is a good place to start learning more about them.</p>
 <h4>Software</h4>
 <p>
    A huge part of becoming an effective digital forensics investigator is to be familiar with all the major computer forensics software. There are well-known commercial digital forensics software tools out there, such as EnCase and Forensics Toolkit, or FTK. There are also open-source and free digital forensics software. These include Autopsy and SANS Investigative Forensic Toolkit, or SIFT. We can also categorize the digital forensics software products based on the comprehensiveness of the features they provide. When an application provides all or most of the features necessary for you to conduct a digital forensics investigation, we call it a digital forensics software suite. Software tools such as EnCase, FTK, and Autopsy fall under this category. There are also computer forensics utilities that focus only on a single aspect of digital forensics investigations. For example, FTK Imager solely focuses on obtaining an image of an evidence drive. Tools such as dcfldd or dd also provide similar features. Hex editors allow you to examine your file at a binary level. What's really handy is packaging open-source and free forensics programs into a Linux operating system distribution. This way you don't have to install anything and start using them out of box. The digital forensics OS distributions also offer an isolated environment which is important to prevent tampering. You can install them on a physical machine or virtual machine. My hope is that by the time you're done with this course, you'll have at least a basic understanding of how we use these software solutions in a digital forensics context.</p>
   <h4>Understanding Hexadecimal Numbers</h4>
   <p>
The knowledge of hexadecimal numbers is essential in the toolbox of a digital forensics investigator. One of the motivations for using hexadecimal numbers is that it's often necessary to investigate data at a binary level. We use binary numbers to represent everything on a computing device. Binary numbers rely on only two symbols, zero and one. Machine code is strings consisting of zeros and ones. It's the only language your computer speaks. Criminals frequently hide or fabricate their data at the machine code level. Therefore, as a digital forensics investigator, you should also be able to examine your evidence in its native format, that is, combinations of zeros and ones. Now, the challenge associated with reading machine code is that there are simply too many digits to deal with. A more compact way to represent binary numbers makes human inspection much easier. The way you represent your data in machine code is called encoding. For example, to encode A, we need eight binary digits, zero one zero zero zero zero zero one. As you can see, displaying the raw binary data takes up a lot of space. Detecting a pattern is also more difficult, because of their similarities. Hexadecimal representation, on the other hand, is much more compact and easier to examine, which increases readability and facilitates spotting a specific pattern. Another reason we use hexadecimal numbers to represent binary numbers is the ease of conversion. I told you that letter A requires eight binary digits to encode, as shown here. In hexadecimal, we just need two digits to represent the same number, which are four and one. Think about the difference between zero one zero zero zero zero zero one versus four one. Which one do you think is easier to manage? Each binary digit is referred to as a bit. One byte consists of eight bits. Usually, one byte is all it takes to represent a character in an alphabet. The hexadecimal number system uses base 16, which means that it uses 16 different symbols, zero through nine and A through F, to represent the magnitudes, such as 10 through 15. Each hexadecimal digit is capable of representing four binary digits. One one one one is the biggest binary number you can represent with one hexadecimal digit, which is F. The knowledge of hexadecimal number system will help you in your future digital forensics investigations, because you are bound to handle it in your Hex Editors. Many digital forensic tools also present data to their end users in hexadecimal numbers.</p>  
<h4>Understanding Offset</h4>
<p>
We occasionally see or hear the term offset in the digital forensics literature or talks. You may have wondered what offset means. Your understanding of the concept of offset is critical in analyzing and interpreting your data in digital forensics, not to mention following a lecture or an article. Offset is significant especially in the context of locating a piece of information in your dataset. Simply put, offset is a way to refer to a location from a particular reference point, either the beginning of a file, the beginning of a sector, or the beginning of an entire drive, by specifying their distance in bytes. Basically, that's it. That's the whole idea behind offset. To do this, we use hex numbers to record the number of bytes between a reference point and a location of our interest. By the way, hex here is short for hexadecimal. Let's say the offset is one zero in hex, which means the current location of a piece of data is 16 bytes away from a reference point. We use a particular offset notation to make it clear that it's a hex number as shown here. The prefix zero and lowercase X denote that the offset amount is in hex. Here, 0x10 means the offset amount is one zero in hex, the subscript 16 is there to indicate that we are using base 16. Now, with this newly gained knowledge of offset, you can locate any piece of information in a file or drive. Before you feel more comfortable, you need lots of practice. It's crucial that you try this on your own using tools like Hex Workshop.</p>
