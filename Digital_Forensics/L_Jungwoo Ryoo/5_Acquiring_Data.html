        <h4>Data Acquisition Approaches</h4>
        <p>After taking key precautions to preserve your evidence, you're finally ready to acquire your data. There are many ways of acquiring data in computer forensics. Static acquisition is one of the most basic and common ways to acquire data. Static acquisition retrieves data from a nonvolatile source such as a hard drive or USB drive. In a nonvolatile source, data still remains on the storage device after power is turned off. Live acquisitions are becoming more necessary these days because of changes in the computing technologies, particularly in the area of encryption. Live acquisition acquires data from a volatile source such as main memory, also known as random access memory, or RAM. In a volatile source, data goes away from the storage device after it's turned off. In a volatile source, data goes away from the storage device after the power is turned off. In addition to the static and live acquisitions, there is another type of acquisition which is remote acquisition. Remote acquisition is done through a network connection and involves a client-server architecture. In many cases, you install a client on a machine from which you want to retrieve the data. Remote acquisition is a form of live acquisition because it requires an up and running computing device whether it's a server or a client. The current trend I observe is that live and remote acquisitions are becoming more prevalent due to the encryption challenge. Static acquisitions are more difficult especially these days because a data drive gets encrypted when a computing device is inactive. What this means is that by the time you're trying to do a static acquisition, all you can get is an encrypted version of the data you're seeking.</p>
        <h4>Static Acquisition with open-source tools</h4>
        <p>There are plenty of open-source utilities out there you can use to get an image of a drive. We'll try to use an open-source tool called DD to get an image of a USB drive. Our goal here is to get an image of an entire physical drive, rather than a partition on the physical drive. Therefore, we'll be using 4/dv 4/sdb instead of... dev std1... to refer to... our USB drive. We already looked at finding out how a USB drive is recognized in a file system on Ubuntu. The command here is very simple. Just type sudo space... "dd" space... "if" "if" here stands for input file... equal sign, forward slash dev... forward slash... sdb instead of sdb1, which is a partition. Next... type a space... and then "of" or open file equal sign... and then the target file name of the image. Let's use... "usb" underscore "image" dot forward slash "usb" underscore "image" The dot here, once again stands for the current directory... and then the extension dot... "dd" Press enter... Because you're using sudo... it's asking for... the password. Press enter... After you type your password... the imaging process has just now began, and until it's done, your command prompt won't return. One way of checking whether the file has been actually created is to open another terminal window to see the name of the files showing up in your directory. So we'll just do that and then simply type "ls". Go to file... choose 'New Window'... press enter... As you can see, the file has been created. The file will be getting bigger and bigger as the imaging process is being done. Now, I'll type "ls" space dash "l" to list some more details of the file. "ls" space dash "l" Press enter... The file size is showing up here. Let's try ls, dash, l again. The file size is bigger. This means that the imaging process is going on successfully. DD is one of the most basic tools out there, you can use to get your simple imaging task done. But there are more advanced tools for the imaging task your can use to make your job, as a computer forensics investigator, little easier. One of these tools is DCFLDD, a forensic version of DD.</p>
        <h4>Creating split-disk image files with dd</h4>
        <p>There is also a way to split your image file into multiple fragments. This is sometimes necessary because you have to put it on media which have very limited capacities. To do this, we can use dd together with another Linux utility. Type dd, space, input file, equal sign, forward slash dev sdb, which is the physical USB drive connected to my computer. Instead of typing of, or output file, and then equal sign target, filename here, we'll be using something called a filter. The role of a filter in Linux is that it will be taking the output of the previous command and pass that output as an input to the next command. Whatever is coming out of the dd input file command, the output of that will go to the next command as an input. In this case, the output sent as an input will be the image file, but we'll be splitting it into multiple files. The command we need for this is split, the split file size of my choice here is 650 megabyte. That's why we type pipe, space, split, space, dash b, space 650m, space dash, space usbimage, and type a dot as a file extension so that, when the files are created, they will be beginning with this name usbimage dot. The file extensions will be different in a sequential order, to reflect the fact that a single image file is now split into multiple files. You need sudo in front to run this command. Press enter. The imaging process has begun, while it's getting done, we can go ahead and open up another terminal window to see the progress. Go to File, New Window. Type ls, press enter, type ls again, press enter, so far there has been only one file created, usbimage.aa, but there will be additional files getting created. Now you see some additional files, usbimageab, usbimageac. There will still be more files coming after this, but learning about these additional options for imaging, you can have more flexibility in dealing with whatever situation is thrown at you.</p>
       <h4>Static acquisition with dcfldd</h4>
        <p>Dcfldd is a forensic version of dd. It's also an open-source and free computer forensics tool. I'll teach you how to use dcfldd to acquire an image from a USB drive. We'll start by typing dcfldd. Just as in the dd command, type if (info file) equal sign and the location of your source drive, in this case, our USB drive, which is /dev /sdb and then, space, of (outward file) equal sign and then the target file name. We'll call it usbimage.dd Here, we'll be using a couple more options which is not available to dd. We'll use hash algorithm, md5 option so type hash equal sign md5 space. We'll also create a hash log and then name the log file as usbimage.log So type hashlog equal sign usbimage.log What this will do is, by the end of the imaging process, dcfldd will be producing an md5 hash value of the image. And then, store the hash value in the usb image.log file. Another nice feature of dcfldd is that it shows the status of your imaging process, it shows how many bytes have been written so far. You need to run this command as root again, so add sudo in the very beginning. Press enter. The imaging process is finally over. Let's check the usbimage.log file. To see the content of this file, we'll be using a command called more. Type more, space usbimage .log Press enter. As you can see, the md5hash value of your image is now showing. Let's also check whether the image file has been created. Type ls, press enter, and you can see usbimage.dd file. As you can tell, dcfldd has more computer forensics features compared to dd. Plus, it's easier to use. Although, the dcfldd software is free, you may still have to install it to your favorite LINUX distribution.
