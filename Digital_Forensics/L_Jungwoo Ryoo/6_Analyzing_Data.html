        <h4>Forensic Data Analysis</h4>
        <p> Digital forensic investigators spend the majority of their time analyzing their data. Analysis is the culmination of a forensics investigation process. All the work we do for preparing, preserving and acquiring data is really for making the analysis step go smoothly. Analyzing data involves lots of searching, and indexing is a technique that helps accelerate the search process. All major digital forensic products use indexing to improve their speed. Autopsy is an open source digital forensic suite. It comes with powerful search and report generation features. It's really nice that you can download Autopsy for free, and try it for learning purposes. Commercial forensics software suites are quite expensive, and even cost prohibitive for individuals. If you work for a small organization with limited budget, or have personal needs to conduct digital forensic investigations, Autopsy, is a perfect tool for that. We have a couple of dedicated lessons to check it out more. It's also nice to explore specialized forensic utilities like Hex Workshop. Although not free, you can download a trial version and play with it. There are some very useful features like bit-shifting and file type information extracting which Hex Workshop provides. Criminals are always trying to mislead you to protect their secrets, but a tool like Hex Workshop can help you see through all their deceptions. In addition to changing file extensions and shifting bits in a file, crooks and spies also hide information in picture files. A stenography tool like OpenStego is what they use to do this. We have a lesson for it too, and you will get a decent exposure. There are many more data analysis techniques and mechanisms out there. What we cover in this course is only the tip of an iceberg. Although not exhaustive, you will still have a good feel for what analysis means in digital forensics by the time you're done with all the lessons in this chapter.</p>
        <h4>Indexing</h4>
        <p>Indexing is another very important feature in a computer forensics software suite, especially in terms of searching. Indexing refers to the process of creating a catalog by going through an evidence drive and recording the location of each data item. To give you an analogy, creating an index for a book is similar to creating an index for an evidence drive. Once you create an index in your book, you can go to a page of your interest very quickly based on a keyword. The same applies to your evidence drive. Once you have your indexing done, the speed of searching gets faster because there is now a direct mapping between your search keyword and the location containing the keyword in your evidence drive. All you have to do is to go to a location according to the index without really having to do the same search over and over again every time you look for a keyword. Initially, indexing takes a long time because it has to go through every single data item in your evidence drive, and then somehow record the location of each data item according to its keyword. Therefore, typically, when you try to acquire an image out of an evidence drive, you always have an option to do your indexing. Indexing is sometimes referred to as preprocessing. When you see the word preprocessing, you should associate that word with indexing.</p>
        <h4>Searching</h4>
        <p> Having the ability to search is essential in digital forensics. Investigators always have needs to do their keyword searches tied to their investigations. To demonstrate how a search is conducted in a computer forensics suite, let's use Autopsy. Autopsy is one of the most popular forensics software suites out there and I highly recommend it. We'll start by creating a new case. Click on New Case, type your case name, we'll use 001. Choose your Base Directory. We'll click on Browse and choose Desktop. Click on Next. And use case number 001. You don't have to fill out the rest of the information. Click on Finish. Now the next step involves loading an image. I already created an image of an evidence drive. We'll be using that image for this exercise. Click on Disk Images or VM File. Click on Next, click on Browse. Choose usbimage.001. Click on Open. By the way, you'll find this image file in your exercise folder. Click Next. Click Next again. Click on Finish. Your image is now successfully loaded. Go ahead and select Data Sources. Click on the plus sign, click on the plus next to usbimage.001, select volume two, and you can see the files inside that volume. One of the things you notice here is files with X marks. What this means is that the files have been deleted, however, your computer forensics suite is able to detect these deleted files and you can even recover them by right clicking on the file, for example, dreamCar.jpg. And then choose Extract Files. We'll now try to export the file to our desktop. We'll go ahead and choose Desktop and click on Save. And you see the file just created on your Desktop. Let's see if we can open it. What a handsome car. Let's go ahead and close it. Click on OK here. Next, we'll conduct a search which is our main mission here. We'll try to find all the files that contain a name, in this case, Bill, so click on Keyword Search, type Bill here and then click on Search. Out of all the files we have on the Disk Image, there's only one file that contains the name Bill. This is a very useful feature not only for conducting your computer forensics investigation but also for anything you do on a daily basis. You always have a need for looking for a file according to a keyword. Of course, any computer forensics software suite should come with a feature like this but they're not all created equally. How well their search feature works could be a good way to measure the quality of a computer forensics suite.</p>
        <h4>Autogenerating Report</h4>
        <p>Having the ability to auto-generate a report is a very useful feature. Investigators usually auto-generate their reports and use them as a starting point. We will use Autopsy to demonstrate how you can auto-generate a digital forensics report. We already loaded our image here. First, let's mark a piece of evidence so that it appears in your report. Go to Data Source, click on the plus sign, choose usbimage, Click on the plus sign, click on volume two. Let's pick a file here. I'm going to choose dreamCar.jpg again, do a right-click and then choose Add File Tag, next select Tag and Comment. I'm going to leave a comment as comment. Click on OK and you can see the icon over there. Now, the evidence is marked and it's going to show up in your report for sure. Let's generate our report. Go to Tools, choose Generate Report. The default choice is fine, HTML Report. Click on Next, click on Finish. Close. To see your report, go to Reports. Click on HTML Report, double-click it. Now, next to the star icon, you see Tagged Files. Click on the link, and you can see the actual picture file. Go back, as you can see, the evidence you marked is now showing up with your comments, which is comment. Right there. Any mainstream computer forensics software suite should come with a feature to auto-generate a report like this. If you don't see it, you should seriously doubt the quality of the software.</p>
        <h4>Hex Editor Analysis of a file with a wrong file extension</h4>
        <p> Criminals often simply change the extensions of files to mislead computer forensics investigators. But the wrong file extension is difficult know exactly what the original file type was. To find out the true type of a file you could use a hex editor. We have a mystery file here on the desktop called secret.jpg and now I'll try to open it with the built in Windows Photos app. The Windows Photos app is complaining because this is not a picture file and that is a clue that something's not right with the file extension. Let's close the Photos app and then open Hex Workshop. Click on File. Click Open. Choose secret.jpg. Click Open. What you see here is all in hex numbers. These beginning bits of the file are called the file signature. The file signature of this file is 50, 4b, 03, 04, 14, 00, 06, 00 and this is our lead. It also shows that XML here and we know, somehow, it's related to XML but we don't know exactly what file type this is. For later use, let's simply copy the file signature. Go to Edit. Choose Copy. Now let's close Hex Workshop. There are tables of file signatures and they're called magic tables. You can find them on the internet. Here is one such website featuring a search option. Let's choose Signature and paste our file signature right here into the search field. Hit Submit. As soon as I do that, multiple matches show up. Now I know it's MS Office 2007 file signature. Next, we'll try to change the file extension of the image file and see what happens. Let's try docx. Choose Rename. Change the file extension to D-O-C-X. Press Enter. It's asking whether I really want to do this and the answer's Yes. Click on Yes. Let's try to open the file. And the file opens successfully, which means that this is the right file type and it says, "This is a test!" Did you enjoy this experience? After this you should be able to find out the true file types of any files out there whose file extensions might have been changed.</p>
        <h4>Hex Editor Analysis of a bit-shifted file</h4>
        <p>Many times criminals simply shift bits in a file to hide a secret. In this case, to reveal the secret, all you have to do is to shift the bits back to their original positions. To do this, you can use a hex editor. Here we have a mystery file called secret.txt. Let me try to open this file using Notepad. I don't know what happened to the original text, but my strong suspicion is that the bits in the file might have been shifted. To know whether this is true or not, I'm going to open this file in Hex Workshop. Go to File, click Open, choose secret.txt, Open. To shift the bits in this file, you have to make some changes in the configuration of Hex Workshop first. Go to Options, choose Toolbars, select Data Operations, and enable it. Click OK. As soon as you do that, you see buttons to shift bits to the right, or to the left. We'll try to shift the bits to your left first. Click on this icon. I'm going to set it to eight bits, click OK. It's still scrambled. Now let's try to shift the bits to your right. Close the file. Don't save the changes. Let's open the file again. Now I'll try to shift the bits to my right. Click this icon, set it to eight bit. Click OK. As you can see, the secret message is now revealed. Shifting bits is one of the most basic techniques you can use to hide your secret. Maybe you can use this technique to keep your secret diary.</p>
        <h4>Steganography</h4>
        <p>Steganography is a way to hide information inside the picture file. Just like any other files, we store pictures in zeroes and ones on our computer. The smallest unit of a picture is a pixel and a picture file stores its pixel information in a binary number in a raster file format. Assume that we use 24 bits to store a pixel. If we change the last bit of each pixel data, it won't change the pixel too much in terms of its color. This is why we can change a picture by embedding our own information into the pixel data and still make it look indistinguishable from its original. If we have 10,000 pixels in a picture, we have 10,000 opportunities to slightly change their binary representations. OpenStego is a free steganography tool. You can download it from this website. Let's give it a try. The user interface is fairly simple. The first field asks for a message to hide. I already created the secret message called message.txt. And this is what it looks like. And let's go ahead and load it. The cover file refers to an image where my secret message will be embedded. It's this image file, olives.png. And let's load it, too. Output stego file is a new picture file to be created out of my cover file and will contain the secret message file information. I'll just specify the path and the file name here. We'll call the new file stego.png. We also have an option to encrypt the secret message. We'll use the default encryption algorithm, which is AES. We'll also provide the password. (typing) That's it. Click on hide data. And you see the stego file that's created. Let's open the stego.png file side-by-side to the olives.png file. Can you tell the difference? I can't. It'll be extremely difficult to find out which image is the one containing secrets, unless you created it.</p>
