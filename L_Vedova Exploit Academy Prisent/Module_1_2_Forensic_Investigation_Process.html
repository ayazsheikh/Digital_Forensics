<h2> Forensic Investigation Process</h2>
<dfn>A methodological approach to <b>investigate</b>,<b>seize</b>, and <b>analyze digital
     evidence</b> and then manage the case from the time of search and seizure to reporting 
     the investigation result.     
</dfn>
<h2>Importance of Forensic Investigation Process</h1>

<p>As digital evidence is fragile in nature, follwing strict guidelines and thorough
   forensic investigation process that <b>ensures the integrity</b> of evidence is critical to
   prove a case in the court of law.
</p> 
<p>The forensics investigation process to be followed should <b>comply</b> with <b>local laws and
   establish precedents</b>. Any breach/deviation may jeopardize the complete investigation.
</p>
<p>The investigators <b>must follow a repeatable and well-documented set of steps</b> such that
   every iteration of analysis provides the same findings; else, the findings of the investigation 
   can be invalidated during the cross examination in a court of law.
</p>
<h2>Phases Involved in the Forensics Investigation Process</h2>
<ol>
<li>Pre-Investigation Phases
    <ol>
    <li>Deals with tasks to be performed prior to the commencement of the acutal investigation.</li>
    <li>Involves setting up a computer forensics lab, building a forensics workstation, developing 
       an investigation toolkit</li>
    </ol>
</li>
<li>Investigation Phases
    <ol>
        <li>The <b>main phase</b> of the computer forensics investigation process.</li>
        <li>Involves acquisition, perservation, and analysis of <b>evidentiary data</b> to identify the 
            <b>source of the crime</b> and the culprit behind it.
        </li>
    </ol>
</li>
<li>Post-investigation Phases
    <ol>
        <li>Includes <b>documentation</b> of all actions undertaken and all findings uncovered during
        investigation.</li>
        <li>Ensures that the report is easily explicable to the target audience and that it provides
            <b>adequate</b> and <b>acceptable</b> evidence.

        <p><b>Points to remember when documenting the crime scene</b></p>
        <p><ul>
            <li>Document the physical crime scene, noting the position of the system and other equipment, if any</li>
            <li>Document details of any related or difficult-to-find electronic components</li>
            <li>Record the state of computer systems, digital storage media, and electronic devices, including their power status.</li>
